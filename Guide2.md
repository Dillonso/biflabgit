# Git guide 2 - Resolving conflicts

In an ideal world, everyone involved in a group porject will edited only that which was delegated to them, with the project being modular (split into enough bits) so that there are no more than one person working on a project. In reality, this is a little more tricky and the inevitable conflict will result.  

You may have thought about what we've dealt with previously and reckon: 

> "All well and good, sir, but what if my friend and I work on the same file? Will ``Git`` know who did what and change things in a rational way?"

All that you touch
All that you see
All that you taste
All you feel
All that you love
All that you hate

All you create
All you destroy
All that you do

All that you eat
everyone you meet
All that you slight
everyone you fight
All that is now
All that is gone
All that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon.
There is no dark side of the moon really.
Matter of fact it's all dark.

# Introduction to Git 

This guide is a very brief overview of ``git`` and will be alinged with the lectures as presented in the lab.  It is by no means a complete guide. 

## About this guide

A few things before we start. This guide is rendered in a neat, pretty way as you're reading it.  It is written in "markdown".  You may be familiar with "markup" languages such as HTTML for rendering pretty pages in a browser.  Markdown is a lightweight alternative that allows for the creation of professional looking documents without too much hassle.  Oh, and because the strucutre is simple, it is a trivial task to look at ``diffs`` (more on this later). 




## Creating a git repository

Although it isn't absolutely crucial to create a repository on GitHub, it is prudent to understand the workings of git in the context of a remote repository as you may very well be required to work on projects hosted on Github in the (possibly near :-) ) future.

So first, create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com). The steps are rather intuitive.  Once you've created your account - and please take your time, there is no rush - create an empty repository called "simplerepo".  You'll be notified with the following:

xx

So let's fetch this repo. We can open a terminal in your favourite OS.  Invoke the following command.

```shell
werner@parker:~/> git pull https://github.com/[yourchosenusername]/simplegit.

```
